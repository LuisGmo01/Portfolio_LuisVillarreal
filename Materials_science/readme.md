# Computational Materials Science and Data Visualization.

As part of my bachelor in physics I worked on a team centered in using numerical calculations from quantum mechanics to describe and model the properties of different nanomaterials.

I worked in two projects:

- Evaluating the detection and trapping of small gas molecules on hydrogenated siligene
  This project consisted on making DFT calculations on siligane (a semiconductor material based on SiGe) to evaluate its properties and potencial to capture and detect certain molecules.
  The results were satisfactory as it was [published in a high impact physics journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/aca22b) (DOI 10.1088/1402-4896/aca22b).

- Study on the oxidation mechanism of siligene using DFT.
  In this project i developed DFT calculations to evaluate the oxidation mechanism of the SiGe monolayer, it was part of my dissertation project and is currently on evaluation to be published in a scientific journal. Some result are now public and have been presented in different meetings.
