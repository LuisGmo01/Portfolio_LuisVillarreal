# OXXO Data Analysis

OXXO is a mexican grosery store chain, with big presence every corener of Mexico. In this project I made a analysis of all OXXO's stores registered by the Statistics and Geography National Institute (INEGI) in the National Statistical Directory of Economic Units.
The projects consisted of 3 stages:
- Data gathering from INEGI
- Data cleaning with SQL
- Data visualization in Tableau

  In firts place the data was gathered using a API that is available in python and then stored in a csv file. After that I exported the csv data to Excel and from the Excel file I created a database in SQL where I was able to clean the data, as it cointained some problems in the formatting that caused trouble in Tableau. Finally I visualized the data using Tableau and created a   [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/OXXO_DENUE_data/Dashboard1?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
